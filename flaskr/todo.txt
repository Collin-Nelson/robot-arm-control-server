Also, queue.get() if the queue is empty will form an infinite loop. I might need a different queue implemenetation or to check that the queue is not empty every time I use queue.get()

Map all inputs to particular GCODE commands - make sure all GCODE commands are accounted for

Inputs to add:
- Absolute move to a particular X,Y,Z,Rx,Ry,Rz position (values default to zero)
- Jog X,Y,Z,Rx,Ry,Rz (have a default distance/angle, but be able to input a different distance/angle to jog)
	- Be able to change the distance with buttons? 
- Teach position
- Home arm
- Buttons to open/close the end effector
- Load/Run/Stop/Save a program as a text file (and step through the program one command at a time)
- Display for the current command queue and a button to add a command to the queue
- Method/button to set calibration offsets for each joint to make sure zero is really zero
- A way to adjust the tool coordinate offset (XYZRxRyRz)
- Zero return (return to zero point without homing)
- Zero axes button (relative coordinate system?)
- Rapids feed adjustment (5%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
- Feed rate adjustment (-10%, 100%, +10%)
- Tool change button?

Displays to add:
- Display of current joint angles and LS statuses
- Distance to go in each commanded move?
